# image_format_converter

Small project I am doing to learn Rust.

An example of running the project assuming you are in the project's working directory:
`./image_proc -i home/Desktop/image.jpeg -o home/Desktop/image.png`
-i: input flag
-o: output flag

run `./image_proc -h` for a list of format options
-h: help flag

This project is about 80% done. There are some things to iron out for quality.

This project was written on a Linux machine and as such the executable may not work on other platforms. If so, run `cargo build --release` on your native machine.
